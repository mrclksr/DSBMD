# SAMPLE CONFIG FILE FOR DSBMD
##############################################################################
#
# FIELD CODES
#	%u: Will be replaced by the UID of the client.
#	%g: Will be replaced by the GID of the client.
#
# USER DEFINED MOUNT COMMANDS
#	dsbmd will pass the device name, volume label, the filesystem name, the
#	UID and GID of the client mounting the device to the command using the
#	environment variables DSBMD_DEVICE, DSBMD_MNTPT, DSBMD_FILESYSTEM,
#	DSBMD_LABEL, DSBMD_UID, DSBMD_GID, DSBMD_GPHOTO_USB_PORT
#
#	Example:
#
#	#!/bin/sh
#	#
#	# ntfs_mount_rw - Mount a NTFS device for reading and writing.
#	#
#	/usr/local/bin/ntfs-3g -o "uid=${DSBMD_UID},gid=${DSBMD_GID}" \
#	    ${DSBMD_DEVICE} ${DSBMD_MNTPT} || exit 1
#	exit 0
#
#	In dsbmd.conf:
#	ntfs_mount_cmd = /path/to/ntfs_mount_rw
