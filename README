ABOUT
     DSBMD is a media/filesystem type detecting daemon for FreeBSD that allows
     clients to mount storage devices. It is configured to work out of the
     box.

DESCRIPTION
     DSBMD watches the mount table for changes, monitors devd(8) events for
     new storage devices, polls CD/DVD drives and card readers for media
     change events, determines media types, volume names, and filesystem
     types. Mountable devices, changes in the mount table as well as device
     add/remove events and altered states of mountable devices are presented
     to clients. Clients can request DSBMD to mount, unmount, and eject media,
     or set the CD/DVD reading speed.

FEATURES
     Some features are:

     •   Client authentication is handled using UNIX domain-socket
         credentials.  Authorization can be defined on a user and/or group
         basis.

     •   For each supported filesystem, mount flags or external mount commands
         can be defined.

     •   Supported filesystems are: ISO-9660, FAT, NTFS, UFS, Ext2fs, and
         exFAT.

     •   Mounts and unmounts not initiated though DSBMD are detected, and
         necessary action are taken.

     •   Simple plain text protocol. DSBMD can be used and debugged using
         Telnet (telnet -u /var/run/dsbmd.socket) or Netcat (nc -U
         /var/run/dsbmd.socket).

     •   Easy configuration through /usr/local/etc/dsbmd.conf

     •   Support for FUSE

     •   Support for memory disks (md)

     •   Support for Linux LVM logical volumes through geom_linux_lvm(4)

     •   Support for MTP devices

     •   Support for PTP devices

OPTIONS
     -f      Run DSBMD in foreground.

INSTALLATION
     # git clone https://github.com/mrclksr/DSBMD.git
     # git clone https://github.com/mrclksr/dsbcfg.git

     # cd DSBMD && make install

SETUP
     In order to start DSBMD at boot time, add the following line to your
     /etc/rc.conf:

     dsbmd_enable="YES"

     Depending on your needs, install the FreeBSD ports fusefs-exfat,
     fusefs-gphotofs, fusefs-ntfs, and fusefs-simple-mtpfs.  DSBMD comes with
     predefined commands in dsbmd.conf that use these ports to mount the
     corresponding filesystems.

     For further configuration, see dsbmd.conf.

DSBMD PROTOCOL SPECIFICATION
   1.0 CLIENT SIDE

   1.1 CONNECTION
     If a client WITHOUT permission connects, DSBMD sends an error message
     with code ERR_PERMISSION_DENIED (258), and terminates the connection.

     If a client WITH permission connects, DSBMD sends a list of zero or more
     devices using device add messages (2.5.1). The list is terminated by
     sending a ‘=’ on a line by itself.

   1.2 COMMANDS

   General command format
     command [option [arg]] [option [arg]] ... <newline>

     DSBMD sends a reply message for any sent known or unknown command.
     Between the transmission of the command and the reception of the command
     reply message, multiple information and/or device add/remove messages
     (2.1) can occur.

     DSBMD processes each client's commands synchronously, that is, the
     commands will be processed in the same order as they where received.
     After a command's reply message was sent, the next command will be
     processed.  DSBMD supports the following commands:

     mount <device name>
             Mount the given device.

     unmount [-f] <device name>
             If the -f switch is specified, unmounting will be enforced.

     eject [-f] <device name>
             This command unmounts and ejects the inserted media. If the -f
             switch is specified, unmounting and ejecting of the media will be
             enforced.

     speed <device name> <speed>
             Sets the maximum reading speed of the CD/DVD device.

     size <device name>
             This command asks DSBMD for the capacity of a disk.  DSBMD will
             return the total size in bytes, and if the device is mounted, it
             will also return the number of used and free bytes.

     If the speed of a CDROM device was changed, the following message will be
     sent to all connected clients, except for the client who sent the
     command.

           V:dev=<devname>:speed=<speed>

   Device mounted (M)
     If a device was mounted, the following message will be sent to all
     connected clients, exept for the client who sent the command.

           M:dev=<devname>:mntpt=<mounted on>

   Device unmounted (U)
     If a device was unmounted, the following message will be sent to all
     connected clients, except for the client who sent the command.

           U:dev=<devname>:mntpt=<mounted on>

   Daemon shutdown (S)
     If the daemon was terminated, it sends the following message to all
     connected clients:

           S

   2.5.1 COMMAND REPLY MESSAGES

   Error message (E)
           E:code=<error code>[:command=<executed command>]

   Success message (O)
           O:command=<executed command>[:keyword=value] ...

     If a device was successfully mounted, DSBMD replies with the following
     message:

           O:command=mount:dev=<devname>:mntpt=<mounted on>

     If a device was successfully unmounted, DSBMD replies with the following
     message:

           O:command=unmount:dev=<devname>:mntpt=<mounted on>

     If the capacity of a disk device was requested, DSBMD sends the following
     message:

           O:command=size:dev=<devname>:mediasize=<size>:used=<used>:free=<free>

     Where ‘size’ is the storage capacity in bytes, ‘used’ is the number of
     used and ‘free’ is the number of free bytes. If the device/media is not
     mounted, ‘free’ and ‘used’ are 0.
